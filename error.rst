	**pgRouting got a new website!**
	
	It has been a long way but finally we made it: pgRouting got a new website!
	This also includes several other important changes:
	
	* The source repository moved to GitHub: https://github.com/pgRouting/ 
	* The mailing lists run on OSGeo mailing list server
	* The file downloads are hosted on OSGeo server
	* The forum was closed due to spam and we recommend http://gis.stackexchange.com instead (we kept a cached copy as a reference, see :doc:`support`)
	
	We hope the migration doesn't produce a lot of confusion but makes it easier 
	to participate in the project and make development faster and better!
