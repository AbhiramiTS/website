 Make a Donation
======================

Maybe you have used pgRouting for your research project or for some commercial
application or something else. Then we hope that the library and the information
on the pgRouting website helped you to get your work done. Or maybe you're 
planning to use pgRouting for your next project.

pgRouting is an Open Source project and so the users and the community are the
most valuable and most important factor. We appreciate every `feedback, 
question, bug report, patches and contributions <development>`_.

But sometimes financial support makes life easier! And the easiest way to 
collect some funding is probably through donations. 
So if you feel you want to support the pgRouting not only through community 
activity, but also provide some financial support, then feel free to make
some donation through PayPal:

What your donation will be used for?
------------------------------------

You can tell us what you would like to have your donation be used for, or you can 
even sponsor some particular feature! 

Otherwise your donation will support for example:

* Server and hosting expenses (currently Georepublic is hosting the project website)
* Posters and brochures for conferences and events, Materials and handouts for workshops
* Scholarship for students, who applied for Google Summer of Code with a great pgRouting proposal, but were unable to receive one of the rare Google stipends
* Improvement of existing functions and implementation of new features

If the amount of donations is sufficient, they will further support the 
implementation of new features (see :doc:`RFC's <rfc/index>`), improvement of 
documentation and tutorials, etc..


.. note::

	For the beginning (to keep it simple) we're using a private PayPal account
	registered by `Georepublic UG <http://georepublic.de>`_ (Germany). In case 
	the amount of donations will increase by a signifacant amount we might 
	consider to setup some non-profit organisation. Georepublic will report
	donations to the pgRouting PSC.
